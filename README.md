##TC-Casino

So in this lab you will be creating a casino based game.

Your application must have at the very least 3 games.

1. Go Fish a card game
2. BlackJack a card game
3. Craps a dice game

In this repo is a file called UML.pdf

In UML.pdf it shows 2 interfaces which you have to create

1. Game
2. Gamble

All of the Games you create must implement the Game interface, while only games that involve gambling should implement Gamble.

1. BlackJack
2. Craps

Go fish is a friendly game and should not involve gambling.

Also notice that BlackJack and GoFish , both inherit from CardGame. Any logic or fields that both games use should live in the CardGame class, and not in BlackJack and GoFish.

The UML provided is missing objects and definitions you will need to complete this project.

Before you proceed to do any development you will need to have completed and had approved a workable UML diagram.

You can either work by yourself , or in a group no bigger than 3.
